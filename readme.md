This project aims to enable people to implement roblox scripts using
visual programming blocks provided by [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly).

## Why does this project exist?

Because while googling for a way to use a scratch-type visual programming interface to
implement roblox scripts, I didn't really find anything, although others had gone looking
for the same thing before me.

## How does it work?
Bloxcode is made up of two components:

* A Roblox Studio plugin that manages scripts
* A desktop application that exposes a visual programming interface

Once the plugin is installed in Roblox Studio, if both Bloxcode and
Roblox studio are started, they will remain in sync.

Installation:

Eventually this will be published as an official plugin. Until then, you can install
the plugin into Roblox Studio manually:

* Create a new server Script in ServerStorage
* Paste the contents of [Sync.lua](./Sync.lua) into the script
* Right click the script and select Save Local Plugin

Once the plugin is active, it will display a notice indicating if
it is connected to Bloxcode or not.

Removal:

Navigate to the Plugins tab in Roblox Studio and click on the Plugins Folder. Delete the
script that was saved earlier and restart Roblox Studio.


### Bloxcode desktop application

Bloxcode provides a Blockly interface
for editing scripts. Currently the website has a **very basic** interface that will be
updated to be more user-friendly in the future.

## Creating a new script

From the Bloxcode desktop application, click on "New Blox Script", then
enter the name of the script in the prompt. This will create two children in the ServerScriptService:
* A bloxcode source file with a `.blox` extension. This is where the blocks are saved
* A lua server script. This is generated whenever the bloxcode file is saved from the website.

## Edit an existing script

Once connected to roblox studio, select existing scripts from the dropdown to the left.
After a second or two the Bloxcode script should load.

## Limitations

* Only a tiny subset of the roblox api is currently implemented

## Can I help make Bloxcode better?

Yes, please! If there are any features you would like to see implemented, or any bugs you
find, head over to the [github issues](https://github.com/wolfgangmeyers/bloxcode/issues) list for the project and see if someone has already filed an issue. If you find someone
has already filed an issue, add a thumbs-up to the issue to upvote. If not, please file
an issue and include details on what you would like changed.

Also feel free to browse through [discussions](https://github.com/wolfgangmeyers/bloxcode/discussions) or start your own.

Help is also wanted in implementing new blocks that expose the Roblox API. If you would
like to help with adding new blocks, check out the existing [block definitions](./docs/blocks.js) and [toolbox definition](./docs/index.html). The general workflow for
implementing a new block:

* Fork your own version of this repository
* Define a new block using [Block Factory](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/blockfactory/index.html) (TODO: add a guide on how to use this)
* Copy over the block definition (javascript) and Lua generator stub into the [block definitions file](./docs/blocks.js).
* Add the lua code to the generator stub
* Test out your changes locally (TODO: add a guide on how to do this)
* Submit a pull request
